# color-picker
 API usage demonstration using [the color api](https://www.thecolorapi.com/docs#schemes-generate-scheme-get).

 Users can select a seed color using a 'color' input, then select a mode from the dropdown. Clicking on the 'Get color scheme' button will generate a color scheme of 5 colors. 

 Design is based on [this figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/HsYPZjPlbs1oraolaEwsYN/Color-Scheme-Generator-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=SQwtDmhGnVDDOcuN-0), which is a copy from the Scrimba solo project requirement.
